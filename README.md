## Project Description
This game is callesd 'Guess the number'. The computer will select a number between 0 - 10 and it's up to you to guess which number that is! It's a straighforward game, but can have some challenging features in the code.

## Rules
Guess the secret number the computer selected. You have 5 chances to guess. If your guess is too high or too low, you'll get a hint. See how many turns it takes you to win!

## Workflow
I took the following steps to complete the game:
1. Research about the game and wrote down the rules
2. Made a workflow and pseudo coded the game
3. Wrote code for the basic game
4. When basic game worked: added features
5. Repeated writing code and adding features until I was satisfied

## Organization
I used a KanBan board (Trello) to plan my work. I found it a bit hard too stick to it, because it's a relatively straightforward project. Do definetely see the use of it in more complex surroundings. 

I cleaned my repository when I was done. There are the following docs:
1. .gitignore
2. Read me file
4. The actual code
3. Folder with python script

## Links
Include links to your repository, slides and kanban board. Feel free to include any other links associated with your project.
