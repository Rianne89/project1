## Project Description
This game is calles 'Guess the number'. The computer will select a number between 0 - 100 and it's up to you to guess which number that is! I chose this game because it's straighforward, but makes it possible to integrate some fun features.

## Rules
Guess the secret number the computer selected. If your guess is too high or too low, you'll get a hint. See how many turns it takes you to win!

## Workflow
I took the following steps to complete the game:
1. I did some research about the game and wrote down the rules (luckily there aren't many rules..)
2. I 'pseudo coded' the game
